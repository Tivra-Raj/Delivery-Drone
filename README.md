# Delivey-Drone (3D Simulation) by Tivra Raj

- A simple 3D Simulation-puzzled genre-based game where you have to use drone to deliver the packages to its marked destination within the given time.

# How to Play

- Arrow Up / Arrow Down to ascend and descend.
- Left Arrow/ Right Arrow to turn left and right.
- W / S to move forward and backward.
- A / D to move left and right.
- E to Attach and Detach package to/from Drone.

# My Work

-  A simple Simulation-tasked genre-based game.
− Worked on simple flight system and Hovering of Drone and used unity new Input system.
− Used MVCs for Interactable object (like Drone, Packages) for easy management and spawning, as well as used Scriptable Objects for maintain data.
− Used Observer Pattern for Triggering Event (like picking up package and delivering at location).
− Used Object Pooling to reusing the spawning of package and delivery location.
